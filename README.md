# simply-weathery

Desktop only visualization of current weather and forecast.
For mobile users there is a -*quite random*- alert and the app is unusable.

The design changes based only on UTC time beacuse I wasn't able to find neither an up-to-date library nor a free API to convert timezones. Making the calculations myself is defenetly out of this project scope.

The icons were derigned *ad hoc* for simply-weathery.

Made with Current Weather free API by [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/).
